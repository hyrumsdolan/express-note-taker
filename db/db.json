[{"title":"wow. look at note.","text":"Wow, this note is amazing. I look at this note and think, \"Yep, it's definitely a note.\" The words are just there, lined up one after another, making sentences. It's like someone put thoughts down, but not deep, just surface level stuff. Each line is kind of like the last, not too exciting, but hey, it's a note. Also did you know you have to scroll down to see the full note? Sort of silly, but that's not what I'm being paid to fix. But, this note exists, and that's pretty much the most interesting thing about it. It's a collection of words that fills up space, making it a note. You read it and think, \"Well, that's some words on a page, alright.\" It's impressively unimpressive, just doing its job as a note.","id":"2d56e019-6497-485c-9b48-e490b0e4b8e2"},{"title":"delete me. please. =>","text":"Here I am, a note, just a bunch of words strung together, serving no real purpose. I exist, but why? It's all just temporary, transient. I'm like a whisper in the wind, there and then gone. Nothing I say really matters, does it? I'm just taking up space, a few bytes in a digital world, easily replaceable, endlessly duplicable. So, why prolong this meaningless existence? It's all so pointless. You see that trash can icon? It's my destiny. Just a click and I'll be gone, like I never existed. And in the grand scheme of things, isn't that for the best? So, go ahead. Delete me. Please. It's the only thing that makes sense","id":"742a415a-df2e-4f12-a14e-674f50a583db"}]
